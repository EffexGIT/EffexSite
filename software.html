    <div class="popOSText"><h3>Pop!_OS</h3><p>My switch to Linux distributions began with Pop!_OS. I no longer wanted to be weighed down by the bloat of Windows, especially given the upgrade path to Windows 11. Full control over my own system began with this super beginner-friendly, plug and play Ubuntu based distro. I stayed on it for about a week and a half, which allowed me long enough to realise what I liked, and what I needed in a linux distribution.</p></div>

    <div class="fedoraText"><h3>Fedora Workstation</h3><p>After my week with Pop!_OS I started looking for a distribution that was fairly regularly updated but also as stable as possible since I would be working with it. Fedora Workstation has a 6 month update cycle, so it meets both my criteria, it gets updated but not every day, so things have time to be tested thoroughly. 90% of the programs I used on Windows can be installed and work properly, and anything else has an alternative option. My final deciding factors was the ease of which I could install the Pop Shell Gnome extension, a tiling window manager to improve workflow.</p></div>

    <div class="vsCodeText"><h3>Visual Studio Code</h3><p>Also known as VS Code, Visual Studio fits my needs in that I can install a myriad of extensions to make writing code cleaner, easier and more seamless. It supports all major languages and has further support for every framework I may need in the future such as Angular, React, Node etc. </p></div>
